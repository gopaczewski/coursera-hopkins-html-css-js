          <span id="title1">Chicken</span>
          <p>Tsukune is a yakitori version that is prepared with ground chicken. The meat is seasoned, and it is typically formed in oblong patties or small meatballs that are skewered on bamboo sticks. Like other types of yakitori, the skewers are typically seasoned with salt (shio) or tare—subtly sweet combination.</p>

          <p>Gyūdon is one of the most popular and inexpensive fast food dishes in Japan. Its name can be literally translated to beef bowl. The dish consists of beef and onions served over a bowl of rice. Beef and onions are cooked in a combination of mirin, sugar, sake, and soy sauce, imparting a salty-sweet flavor to the dish.</p>

          <span id="title3">Sushi</span>
          <p>Sushi is a popular Japanese dish made from seasoned rice with fish, egg, or vegetables. A sushi roll is shaped inside a thin sheet of seaweed. Sushi comes from a Japanese word meaning "sour rice," and it's the rice that's at the heart of sushi, even though most Americans think of it as raw fish.</p>
